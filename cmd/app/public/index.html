          The compiled image is designed to serve static content only.
          If you are attempting to serve anything more complex than an HTML
          website, you will probably need to create your own repository
          which extends this image, with your own customisations.

            How to serve your own website

          <p>
            In order to serve your own content, replace the contents of the
            '<code>/cmd/app/public</code>' folder with the files you wish
            to serve.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            When running this server in a container, it is typically easiest
            to mount an external volume which contains your content at the
            location '<code>/cmd/app/public</code>'.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you can access this webpage from your frontend, then any static
            content which you add to the public folder should be available,
            provided that the environment is configured correctly.
